# Testing Introduction

This section of our docs is about how we test our code. We'll explain the types of testing we do and the tools we use to do it, as well as some examples of how to write tests for our most common cases.

## Table of Contents

1. [**Test Types**](types.md)  
The types of testing we typically write for the project with basic instructions for each type of test. Includes unit tests, functional component tests (via enzyme), and various types of snapshot tests.

1. [**Testing Tools**](tools.md)  
Overview of the tools we are using for running our tests including jest and enzyme, along with links to documentation, etc.

1. **Test Patterns**  
   Best practices and common patterns for testing our basic file types:

   * [Action Creators](testing-actions.md)
   * [Helpers](testing-helpers.md)
   * [Selectors](testing-selectors.md)
   * [Components](testing-components.md)

1. [**Mocking with Jest**](mocking.md)  
Mocking dependencies and stubbing out methods is pretty different in Jest, so this section goes over common mocking strategies and conventions.

1. [**Code Coverage**](coverage.md)  
A small note about how we run code coverage reports with testing.
